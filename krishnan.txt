* Fare Modeling - Mixture of Gamma Distributions - via EM ( Lecture 21 )
* Optimal k-Circuit for small k - Truncated normal priors for each (src,dest) tuple that participate in circuit, MC.
* Hierarchical Model with STAN - fare from (src,dest) <- f( (src,-dest) + (-src,dest) + c)
* Pytorch classifier - predict trip duration given (src,dest,timezone)

--------
 Data: 30 million uber trips between src & dest.
src (or dest): 30 unique locations in nyc (denoted by labels such as 1A, 2C etc).

An edge: is a (src,dest) pair with src != dest. 30*29 = 870 possible edges.
Each edge has a fare distribution with roughly 30 milllion/870 = 34,000 samples.
For each edge, find the median fare.
Ignore edges with median fare < $50

This leaves us with 52 edges (out of 870)

Step1.
Goal: Edge posterior.
Estimands of interest: parameters of edge posterior.
=======================
Model each of the 52 edges with a prior distribution: truncated Normal, with prior mean 50, prior left bound 40, prior right bound 60, prior variance 25.
Obtain likelihood of truncated normal, using sample mean & sample stdev.
Find posterior given likelihood & prior above.

Step 2.
Goal: Circuit posterior
Estimands of interest: parameters of circuit posterior.
========================
Recipe to construct a k-circuit, say k = 3.
A 3 circuit has 3 edges, ab, bc & ca.
Given 52 edges, there are 52*51*1 ,about 2600 circuits.
Circuit prior: Each circuit has a prior distribution given by Normal( 3*50 = 150, 25/3 = 8)
Obtain 1 sample each from the posterior distributions of the 3 edges in the circuit.
Sum up the 3 samples => we now have 1 sample for circuit fare.
Get n samples. Compute circuit likelihood with these n samples.
Given circuit likelihood & circuit prior, we get circuit posterior.

Step 3.
Goal: Optimal k-circuit
Estimand of interest: expected maximum fare for a circuit.
=======================
Pick k-circuit with highest posterior mode.
Find credible interval for estimand.

Step 4. Posterior predictive check
==========================
Say circuit abca is the winner.
We have real data for ab, bc & ca.
For each day, obtain the true circuit fare if a driver drove ab, bc & ca.
Compare true circuit fare with step 3 results.
